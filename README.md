3. Write a Java program to find the second smallest element in an array.

4. Write a Java program to add two matrices of the same size.

5. Write a Java program to move all 0's to the end of an array. Maintain the relative order of the other (non-zero) array elements.

6. Write a program to remove the duplicates from a sorted array change them into 0 and add 0 in the end.

a. input: [2,2,3,3,4,4,4,11,11,11,11]

b. output:[2,3,4,11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

7. Write a Java program to get the difference between the largest and smallest values in an array of integers. The length of the array must be 1 and above.

8. Write a Java program to remove the duplicate elements of a given array and return the new length of the array.

9. Write a Java program to find the sum of the two elements of a given array which is equal to a given integer.

a. Sample array: [1,2,4,5,6]

b. Target value: 6.

10. Write a Java program to find the two elements from a given array of positive and negative numbers such that their sum is closest to zero.
